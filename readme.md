In Conway's Game of Life, a grid of "alive" and "dead" cells advances through states according to rules, in a deterministic way.  It is not truly reversible since there are multiple states which can turn into any given state.  As an example, if you have a blank grid, at the next state, it will be a blank grid.  If you have two "alive" cells next to each other, and that's all, then at the next state, it will also be a blank grid.

My goal here is to provide some way of going backwards through the game of life in  a way that prefers simplicity so that I can make various stable designs, and then work backwards to a simpler configuration which will result in my design once I run the game on it.  The result will not be unique, and this will not be an effective way to determine the original configuration, but it will give one possible original configuration.
