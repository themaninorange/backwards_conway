\f0\fs24 \cf0 In Conway\'92s Game of Life, a grid of \'93alive\'94 and \'93dead\'94 cells advances through states according to rules, in a deterministic way.  It is not reversible, because there are multiple states which can turn into any given state.  As an example, if you have a blank grid, at the next state, it will be a blank grid.  If you have two \'93alive\'94 cells next to each other, and that\'92s all, at the next state, it will also be a blank grid.\

My goal here is to provide some way of going backwards through the game of life in  a way that prefers simplicity so that I can make various stable designs, and then work backwards to a simpler configuration which will result in my design once I run the game on it.}
